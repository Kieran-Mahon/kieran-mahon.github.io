                    This is my final year R&D project at AUT. I was in a group with four others who worked
					with the New Zealand video game company Ninja Kiwi. We were tasked to design and produce
                    an internal prototype of a web tool which allowed viewing of community events within their
					games. This system allowed easy access to see important information for upcoming and past
					events such as start/end times, the type of event, and the game its from. The project was
					built-in C# using ASP.NET (Razor Pages). I mainly worked on the event viewing area (shown
					below). This included taking in the data, filtering out unneeded data, sorting it and then
					generating the HTML code which displays it.

                    This is a React-based website which shows Auckland Transport (AT) vehicle data. The data is sourced

                    project to mess around with large data APIs within React.

					<br />
                    This project was my group project (myself with 3 others) for my Software Development Practices
                    paper. We designed and created a Unity timed escape game. The idea of the game is that you are
                    stuck on a ship which you are trying to get off as it has been hit by an asteroid. The game is
                    in 3D and uses a first-person controller. It also has multiple internal systems such as a
                    saving and loading system, settings system, holding system (can pick up, move, and drop objects),
                    time limit system, and different gravity system. The project was completed over a semester, and
                    we completed multiple sprints via Scrum. We planned and ran the whole project as if it was a
                    real development project.

					<br />
					I first started this project during my final years college as I wanted to learn more about Unity
					and the systems that would need to be learnt for developing a video game. In 2023, I picked up the
					project again to clean it and upgraded it to the latest version of Unity, I did this so it would
					fit the current Unity standards and would work with Unity's Universal Render Pipeline.<br />This is
					a simple game where you are a ball and must roll down a hill without hitting anything on the way.
					It has a saving/loading system, a player skin/material system where you can switch and buy skins,
					a currency system, two game modes – an infinite one and a levelled one. This project taught me a
					lot about animations, particles, GUI, sound, lighting, and game design within the Unity Engine.
					Below are some images of the game. You can also play it online via clicking the “Play Online”
					button to the right.

					grid to get to the exit. There are enemies on the way and items which you can pick up. If you
					walk into an enemy you must fight them. There is a combat system, item collection system, saving
					system, and local leaderboard system. The game can be found on my GitHub (link to the right).

                    This was one of the first projects I ever did. I learnt a lot from it, but it has a lot to
                    improve on such as switching to JavaScript objects and simplifying the code. This project
                    is a money clicker game built on Code.org using JavaScript. You are able to click the money
                    button to earn money then buy buildings and upgrades to make money quicker. Some of the
                    systems within the project include; a custom saving system, a customisation system (change
                    colours), an achievement system, and a reset and start again system.
