        <p class="home-text">
            My name is Kieran Mahon. I am a recent graduate in Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences,
            with a double major in Software Development and Data Science, with a focus on Software Development.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            I started programming when I was in Primary School and was invited to join Code Club Aotearoa, where I was introduced to JavaScript,
            Scratch, and a few other frameworks and languages (node.js, python).<br />
            During High School I learnt Visual Basic, QB64, Unity/C#, and widened my knowledge of JavaScript. I used this knowledge to produce
            projects and games for my assignments and for myself throughout High School.<br />
            At University I learnt Java, ASP.net (Razor Pages), PHP, HTML, Python data programming, forecasting, data models, data
            modelling, and text/vision intelligence.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            I have a strong knowledge of the software development pipeline, which includes knowledge of methodologies/tools such as Git/GitHub,
            Trello/Jira, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban. I have applied this knowledge to personal projects and assignments throughout my education.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            I have recently completed my final year R&D project at AUT in which I was working with a team of 5 to develop a prototype for an event
            viewing system for a New Zealand video game company. This project has allowed me to apply my knowledge to a real-world problem.
        </p>
        <p class="home-text">
            I have a strong passion for programming and for expanding my technical knowledge, I love to solve problems
            and can adapt to new things very easily.
