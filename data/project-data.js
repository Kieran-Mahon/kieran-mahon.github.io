    `In my final year at AUT I completed a Research and Development project in a team of four for the New Zealand video game company Ninja Kiwi.
    We were tasked to design and produce an internal prototype of a web tool which allowed viewing of community events within their games.
    This system allowed easy access to see important information for upcoming and past events such as start/end times, the type of event, and the game its from.
    The project used C# and the ASP.NET (Razor Pages) framework. I mainly worked on the event viewing area (shown in the image).
    This included taking in the data, filtering out unneeded data, sorting it and then generating the HTML code which displays it.`,

    In this project, we designed and created a timed escape game in Unity.
    The idea of the game is that you are stuck on a ship which you are trying to get off as it has been hit by an asteroid.
    The game is in 3D and uses a first-person controller.
    It also has multiple internal systems such as a saving and loading system, settings system, holding system (can pick up, move, and drop objects),
    time limit system, and different gravity system. The project was completed over a semester, and we completed multiple sprints via Scrum.
    We planned and ran the whole project as if it was a real development project.`,

In 2023, I picked up the project again to clean it and upgraded it to the latest version of Unity, I did this so it would fit the current Unity standards and would work with Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. This is a simple game where you are a ball and must roll down a hill without hitting anything on the way. It has a saving/loading system, a player skin/material system where you can switch and buy skins, a currency system, two game modes – an infinite one and a levelled one. This project taught me a lot about animations, particles, GUI, sound, lighting, and game design within the Unity Engine. Below are some images of the game. You can also play it online via clicking the “Play Online” button to the right.`,
